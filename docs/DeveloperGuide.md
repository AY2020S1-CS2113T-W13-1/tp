## Introduction <a name="intro"> </a>

RevisED is a command line application to help students revise by creating flashcards and taking quizzes, 
and keeping track of their deadlines, tasks and any other important dates. This application allows users to add subjects, 
their different topics and create different flashcards in form of question and answers on each topic. Students can also 
take quizzes which asks them the questions that they added in form of flashcards and prompted to answer them. 
The student can view results of these quizzes immediately and are stored so that students can view them later. 
Additionally, students can delete, and list subjects, topics, and flashcards and find and enter subjects and topics.   

This developer guide is for developers who wish to understand and/or develop ReviseED further. 
This guide includes design, implementation, product scope, user stories, non-functional requirements, glossary, 
testing and development sections to help developers better understand the application.

## Design & implementation <a name= "design"> </a>

This section describes how RevisED has been designed and implemented so that developers can better understand the 
designing of the code, with the help of visual aids.

The application has been broken down into different segments so that users would find it easy to navigate from one segment 
to the next one. There are three segments within the application:
* Main: This segment edits the list of all the subjects present within the application and takes care of relevant commands 
such as add subject, delete subject or find subject.
* Subject: This segment is accessed through the `subject NAMEOFSUBJECT` command. The user would then look at the individual 
subjects and then would be able to add, delete, list or find either tasks or topics.
* Topic : This segment is accessed through the `topic NAMEOFTOPIC` command. The user can add, delete or list flashcards
in this segment.

The code contains the main class Revised, as well as different packages, which combine classes that perform a similar 
functionality. Here are the list of packages:

* Card: In charge of classes related to the subject, topic, flashcard and quiz functionalities
* Command: In charge of reading the command and calling the relevant methods. The package itself holds
the following packages.
* Exceptions: Deals with the various exceptions which are thrown in the application.
* Parser: Parses the commands and instantiates the relevant command classes.
* Storage: Stores the data in an external folder
* Task: Contains the classes for the different types of tasks.
* Ui: In charge of interaction with the user.

### Card Package
The Card package consists of different classes that holds information on the main functionalities of the application,
and is split into 2 packages, quiz and task, as well as Subject, Topic and Flashcard classes.
- Quiz Package
    * Quiz class
    * Result class
    * TopicQuiz class
    * SubjectQuiz class
- Task Package
    * Deadline class
    * Event class
    * Task class
    * Todo class
- Flashcard class
- Subject class
- Topic class

Each of the classes in the card package contains:
* Getters and Setters of its own attributes
* methods that alter an instance of its own class

#### Quiz package <a name = "quiz"> </a>
The `Quiz` package holds the necessary classes for the quiz functionality of this application. The following are
the classes in the package. An abstract`Quiz` class, a `Result` class, a `SubjectQuiz` class and a `TopicQuiz` class.

#### Quiz class <a name = "Qclass"> </a>
`Quiz` class is an abstract class in the `Quiz` package. It is holds the result of a quiz class and the list of flashcards
from any subject or topic classes which the user calls the quiz for. Furthermore, it contains a checkAnswer() method the
checks the answer that the user had given with the correct answer of the quiz. If the user enters the correct answer, the 
existing score is incremented by one. Else, the contents of the flashcards and the incorrect answer provided by
the user are transferred to the  `incorrectAnswers` list. Once the user finished the quiz, the application would print the 
questions that the users did not answer correctly, along the the answer that was provided by the user. 

#### SubjectQuiz <a name = "Qsubject"> </a>
`SubjectQuiz` class inherits from the `Quiz` class and initiates the quiz. The `startQuiz` method calls for the  `setupQuiz` method checks for the presence
of topics or flashcards. Else, the application throws the `NoTopicException` for the former, and the 
`NoFlashcardException` for the latter. If the topics have flashcards, then these are transferred to the 
`SubjectQuiz` class, while the maximum score of the quiz is set to be the total number of flashcards in the list of flashcards
present in the `SubjectQuiz` class . 

The application now returns to the `startQuiz` method and the current score of the quiz is set to zero. Subsequently, the
application begins printing the questions from the flashcards and checks the answer that you provide. If you want to stop the 
quiz, use the `stop` command. The application will then print out the score that you obtain. If you complete the quiz
then the application not only prints the score, but it also prints the incorrect answers from the quiz.

The following diagram shows how you can initiate the quiz for a subject.
![first](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46095141/97313097-3866e200-18a1-11eb-9525-73e38ceb7cbe.png)

#### TopicQuiz <a name = "Qtopic"> </a>
`TopicQuiz` class is similar to the `SubjectQuiz` class, except for the fact that it initiates the quiz
only for the specific topic. Furthermore, this class only throws the `NoFlashcardException` for when the topic does not 
have any flashcards, which is detected by the `setupQuiz` method. The implementation of the `startQuiz` method is similar
to that of the SubjectQuiz class.

##### Result <a name = "Qresult"> </a>
`Result` class  stores the result of a quiz . It has three instance variables, namely the `score` variable
which tracks the score during the quiz, the  `maxScore` variable which is the maximum score that you can get from doing the 
quiz, while the  `description` variable will be a grade given to you depending on your performance.
The  `UpdateResult` method  updates the score of the quiz during the quiz and changes the grade of the quiz. 

#### Task Package <a name = "task"> </a>
The `Task` package holds the necessary classes for the Task functionality of this application. The following are
the classes in the package. A `Task` class, a `Todo` class, a `Deadline` class and an `Event` class.

##### Task class <a name = "Ttask"> </a>
The `Task` class is the superclass of `Todo`, `Deadline` and `Event`. It has attributes such as the description of the task-`String`
and an attribute to check if the task is completed-`Boolean`. It holds basic getters for its attributes, getters such as getting the 
status icon to check if a Task is done-`String`, and getters for the DateTime features of the Deadline and Event classes. It also has
 a toString methods to print the Task.
 
###### Todo Class <a name = "Ttodo"> </a>
The `Todo` class is the class to store information on basic tasks of the user. It contains methods and attributes similar to the
ones found in its superclass `Task`. It has an additional Override toString method, to differentiate between itself and other
tasks, such as Deadline and Event.

An example of how a Todo task "return books" will look like in the command line for user intepretation is shown below.
```
____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
 [T][âœ˜] return books
Now you have 1 task in the list.
____________________________________________________________
```

###### Deadline Class <a name = "Tdeadline"> </a>
The `Deadline` class is the class to store information on tasks of the user that has a deadline. It contains methods and attributes similar to the
ones found in its superclass `Task`, and additional attributes to make it a `Deadline` Task, such as an additional dateTime attribute 
to keep track of the deadline of the task-`LocalDateTime`, an Override toString method, to differentiate between itself and other tasks, such as Deadline 
and Event.

An example of how a Deadline task "return books /by 23:59 10-11-2020" will look like in the command line for user intepretation is shown 
below.
```
____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][âœ˜] return books (by: 11:59 PM 10 Nov 2020)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________
```

###### Event Class <a name = "Tevent"> </a>
The `Event` class is the class to store information of tasks of the user that is an event with a specific date and time occurrence. 
It contains methods and attributes similar to the ones found in its superclass `Task`, and additional attributes to make it a `Deadline`
Task, such as an additional dateTime attribute to keep track of the date and time of the event-`LocalDateTime`, an Override toString method,
to differentiate between itself and other tasks, such as `Todo` and `Deadline`.

An example of how an Event task "event CS2113T meeting /at 12:00 10-11-2020" will look like in the command line for user intepretation is shown 
below.
```
____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][âœ˜] CS2113T meeting (at: 12:00 PM 10 Nov 2020)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________
```

#### Flashcard Class <a name = "flashcard"> </a>
The `Flashcard` class is a class to store information of flashcards. It has attributes such as the question
and answer of each flashcard, a constructor, as well as getters for both question and answer of the flashcards.


#### Subject Class <a name = "subject"> </a>
The `Subject` class is a class to store information of subjects. It has various attributes such as the title of the 
subject-`String`, a list of various topics in a subject-`TopicList`, a list of various tasks present in a subject-`TaskList`
and a list of various results of the quiz of a subject-`ResultList`. It also consists of a constructor, getters to all of the
attributes in the `Subject` class and a toString method to return the title of the subject.

####  Topic Class <a name = "topic"> </a>
The `Topic` class is a class to store information of topics. It has various attributes such as the title of the subject-`String`,
a list of various flashcards in a topic-`List<Flashcard>`, and a list of the results for all topic quizzes-`ResultList`. It also 
contains various constructors, getters for all its attributes, and a toString method that returns the title of the topic.

An example of how classes in the card package interact with each other is shown in the figure below. 
In this example, a student has 2 main subjects, mainly Math and Science. Math has topics algebra and calculus, while science has topics speed and light. He also made flashcards the various topics.

### Command Package
The Command package consists of different classes that executes the various commands of the application due to user input,
and is split into 4 packages, flashcard, subject, task and topic, as well as a abstract command class, that is a superclass of the various classes in the different packages.

* Command: In charge of reading the command and calling the relevant methods. The package itself holds
the following packages.
    - Flashcard
    - Subject
    - Topic
    - Task

### Storage Package <a name = "storage"> </a>
There are two classes inside this package, both of which are inside `Storage.java`. The following diagram shows the
relationship between the two classes.

![StorageClass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97547893-9cfe6b80-198b-11eb-8475-0992c8274ee3.png)

#### StorageBuilder <a name = "Sbuilder"> </a>

`StorageBuilder` class is a static inner class of the `Storage` class. It follows the builder pattern and its sole purpose
is to create `Storage` instances. The [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) is used to deal 
with the decrease in clarity due to the increase of the number parameters. Every instance of the `Storage` class should 
be created through `StorageBuilder`, and this is enforced by disabling the public constructor of the `Storage` class.

#### Storage <a name = "Sstorage"> </a>

`Storage` class handles every operation that involves data storage, including saving, loading, and exporting of 
application data. As such, it depends on classes whose data should be saved, which is shown in the diagram below.

![StorageClassDependency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97547894-9e2f9880-198b-11eb-8463-ac4c8f67ad20.png)

##### Storing data 

`Storage` class stores the data following the same logical structure (subject -> topic) of the application to 
make the stored data more presentable to the user. `Subject` and `Topic` data are stored as nested directories, while 
`Flashcard` and `Result` data are stored in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format so that they are readable 
to the users and allows them to change the saved data manually. `Task` data are stored differently as text files due to 
legacy reason, but they are also readable and can be changed manually as well. An example of the structure mentioned is 
shown in the figure below.

```
Maths
â”œâ”€â”€ Algebra
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ results.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ flashcards.json
â”œâ”€â”€ results.json
â””â”€â”€ tasks.txt
```

This class also stores the data in a cascading manner, meaning that when a call to save topics is made, all the data 
under the topics will be saved. Similarly, when a call to save subjects is made, all the data under the subjects
including topics will be saved. The behavior mentioned is shown in the diagram below.

![StorageSaveSubjects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97545777-b356f800-1988-11eb-816d-7d9b343c014f.png)

![StorageSaveTopics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97545783-b651e880-1988-11eb-888e-c5dd6ffccb1a.png)

##### Loading data

The loading of data follows a similar cascading manner as saving, as can be seen in the diagram below.

![StorageLoadSubjects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97545786-b7831580-1988-11eb-828c-ded78ddc150b.png)

![StorageLoadTopics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15065550/97545789-b94cd900-1988-11eb-8882-544bc47c1f4e.png)

Before returning topics and subjects, the methods sort them in alphabetical order to let the users locate their 
subjects or topics more easily. 

## Product scope <a name = "scope"> </a>

This section describes the scope of the application. To be specific, the target audience and 
the uses and benefits of this application.

### Target user profile <a name = "Ptarget"> </a>

The targeted audience are university students , aged 18 - 25 who have access to a computer. The students must be familiar
with applications that run on the command-line interface. Currently, this application is created for students who study in 
Singaporean universities.

### Value proposition <a name = "Pvalue"> </a>


This application aims to help students to keep track of their revision. Students should be
able to revise their subjects effectively through this application by adding various questions
and answers in the form of flashcards. After that, students can refer to the flashcards to
revise the subjects. Furthermore, they can take quizzes and see if they grasp the topics or subjects well
enough to attend their school based exams.

Students who find it hard to keep track of their assignments would also find this application
useful since it lets the students add their tasks. The application then reminds the students
regarding the upcoming tasks, which would prompt the students to prepare them.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Students who find it difficult to organise woudl find this app useful since it
offers a one stop solution to manage both their revision and their upcoming tasks.

## Development <a name="develop"> </a>

### Logging < a name = "log"> </a>
Whenever you need to use logging in a class, add this line 
`private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(<CurrentClass>.class.getName());` to the start
of the class, where \<CurrentClass\> is replaced by the class name you are adding the logger to.

The logging configuration can be found under `src/main/resources/logging.properties`. The current configuration directs
the logs to a file named `revisED%u.log` in the project root directory.
