## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

**revisED** aims to help students to revise their subjects through the creation of flashcards or tasks that have
to be completed. The users can store the tasks under different subjects and flashcards under different topics, which can be created under the
subjects. This application ensures that students would be
able to revise, even if they are doing it at the last minute.

This user guide provides an in-depth documentation on the installation process, the program features, and
the program usage to get you started.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

### 3.4 Other Features <a name="other-feat"></a>
This section expands on the features that are not specific to any part of the previous sections and features that
require further explanations.

#### 3.4.1 Taking quizzes <a name = "takeQuiz"> </a>
Once you have added the necessary flashcards, you can use the Quiz functionality to test yourself. This would
let you gauge how much you understand from the material. This will be beneficial if you are running out of time
to revise your own notes.
 
In this feature, the application prints the questions from the flashcards stored in the application. You need to complete the quiz within a
certain time limit. There are two types of quizzes :
* SubjectQuiz
* TopicQuiz

##### Subject quiz
This type of quiz helps you prepare for a particular subject.The application prints out the questions from the topics present in a subject.
You have 2 minutes to complete the quiz.

Format: `quiz NAMEOFSUBJECT`<br>
Example: `quiz Maths`

Output: `You are about to begin the quiz for maths.You have 2 minutes.`

##### Topic quiz
This type of quiz helps you to prepare for a particular topic. The application prints out all the questions that have been saved in the specific topic .
You have 1 minute to complete the quiz.

> üìùÔ∏è Ô∏è  **_NOTE:_** Ensure that you start a quiz for a subject/topic that has been added to the application 
> and has a flashcard. Else, the application will not start the quiz.

Once you have entered the type of quiz you want to begin, the application starts the quiz. You
are expected to answer these questions.

Format: `Question NAMEOFQUESTION`<br>
Example: `Question: What is distance` <br>

Once the quiz has been completed, the application prints out the scores that you obtained.
You will also be notified about the questions that you did not answer correctly. 

The score is printed in the following format:<br>
* If you get full marks : `Result:4/4 -- Excellent`<br>
* If you get enough marks to pass: `Result:2/4 -- Pass`<br>
* If you fail: `Result:0/4 -- Fail`<br>

The code below shows an example of a result that you can get after attempting a quiz.

<pre><code>____________________________________________________________
Result:2/4 -- Pass
____________________________________________________________
Here are the questions which you got wrong.
           
Question:distance 
Correct Answer: speed x time 
Your Answer: speed x time x time
____________________________________________________________
Question:velocity 
Correct Answer: displacement / time
Your Answer: none
____________________________________________________________</code></pre>

You can stop the quiz by entering `stop`. The application then prints the score.<br>
Format: `stop`<br>
Output:`The quiz has been stopped!`.
<pre><code>
____________________________________________________________
The quiz has been stopped!
____________________________________________________________
Result:1/2 -- Pass
____________________________________________________________
</code></pre>

#### 3.4.2 Viewing quiz results <a name ="result"> </a>
After completing a few number of quizzes, you would want to look at the results of the previous quizzes to see if
you have improved over the time. You can use the `results` functionality to check your results.
This can be done for the subjects or for the topics.

> üìùÔ∏è Ô∏è  **_NOTE:_** Ensure that at least one quiz has been attempted under the subject or topic.

> üìùÔ∏è Ô∏è  **_NOTE:_** The results for a subject is different from the results for a topic. The application only shows
>the result of a subject or topic that you requested for. Entering `results CS2113T` will not show you the results
>that you obtained for the topics in the CS2113T subject and vice-versa.  

#### 3.4.3 Storing data <a name="store"> </a>
When you exit the application, the data you have added to the program is automatically saved to the disk. 
The data is stored under the `data/` folder in the same folder where you run the application. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **_WARNING:_** The data (or any changes to the data) are not saved if the application is closed abnormally 
> (i.e. not via `bye` command).

Instead of storing all data in one file, **revisED** creates a folder hierarchy under `data/` following the logical structure of the
subjects and topics added. For example, if you add a `Maths` subject and a `Algebra` topic under it, a
`Maths/` folder will be created under the `data/` folder and an `Algebra` folder will be created under the `Maths/`
folder, as shown in figure 3.4.1 below. 

<pre>
revised.jar                     <em>--> <b>revisED</b> Application</em>
data                            <em>--> Data main folder</em>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Maths                       <em>--> Maths subject folder</em>
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Algebra                 <em>--> Algebra topic folder under Maths subject</em>
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ topicResults.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flashcards.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subjectResults.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.txt
</pre>
<sup>***Figure 3.4.1** Sample directory structure created*</sup>


The details of the files that are created under each subject and topic folder will be explained below.

> üìùÔ∏èÔ∏è   **_NOTE:_**  The name of the subject and topic folders can be changed manually, and the changes will be reflected
> in the application the next time you launch it.

##### tasks.txt
One `tasks.txt` file will be created under each subject folder. This file contains the tasks (Todo, Event, Deadline) you
have added to a specific subject. An example of the file content is shown below.

<pre>
T | 1 | someTodoTask                                    <em>--> Todo task</em>
D | 0 | someDeadlineTask | 11:59 PM 20 Dec 2020         <em>--> Deadline task</em>
E | 0 | someEventTask | 1:00 PM 10 Nov 2020             <em>--> Event task</em>
</pre>
<sup>***Figure 3.4.2** Sample tasks.txt content*</sup>

The first column of data shows the type of task, where T corresponds to `Todo` task, D corresponds to `Deadline` 
task, and E corresponds to `Event` task. The second column shows if a task is completed, where 0 means not completed 
while 1 means completed. The third column shows the name of a task. Lastly, the fourth column shows the time and date of 
a deadline or event task. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **_WARNING:_** Although you can change the content of this file manually, 
> you are not advised to do so because a mismatch in the format will corrupt the data. 
> **If the data is corrupted, it will not be loaded by the application.**
> Make a copy of the file before making changes if you have to do so manually.

##### subjectResults.json / topicResults.json
One `subjectResults.json` will be created under each subject folder, and one `topicResults.json` will be created 
under each topic folder. `subjectResults.json` stores the quiz results you have obtained from doing quizzes under 
a subject, while `topicResults.json` stores the quiz results you have obtained from doing quizzes under a topic. 
Both of the files have the same content format, and an example of 
the file content is shown below.

<pre>
[
  {                                    <em>--> Result record 1</em>
    "score": 1.0,                      <em>--> Score obtained</em>
    "maxScore": 1.0,                   <em>--> Maximum score that can be obtained</em>

##### flashcards.json
One `flashcards.json` file will be created under each topic folder. This file stores all the flashcard data you 
have added under a specific subject and topic. An example of the file content is shown below.

<pre>
[
  {                                            <em>--> Flashcard 1</em>
    "question": "x + y = 4. y = ? ",
    "answer": "4 - x"
  },
  {                                            <em>--> Flashcard 2</em>
    ...
  },
  ...
]
</pre>
<sup>***Figure 3.4.4** Sample flashcard.json content*</sup>

Each entry enclosed with the curly braces ({}) corresponds to one flashcard.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **_WARNING:_** Although you can change the content of this file manually, 
> a mismatch in the format will corrupt the data. **If the data is corrupted, it will not be loaded by the application.** 
> Therefore, make a copy of the file before making changes if you have to do so.

#### 3.4.4 Loading data <a name="load"> </a>
Similar to <a href =#store>storing data</a>,
when you launch the application, the saved data is automatically loaded from the disk.

> üìùÔ∏è   **_NOTE:_** Loaded subjects and topics will be sorted in alphabetical order, which can be seen when running
> <a href=#list>list</a> command. Flashcards, tasks, and results data, on the other hand, are not sorted and instead
> follow the added order.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **_WARNING:_** If you have manually modified the contents of the files stored with wrong syntax, the files affected 
> will not be loaded (and, instead, empty data will be loaded) when the application launches. 

#### 3.4.5 Exporting data <a name= "export"> </a>
You can export all the data, including the quiz results and tasks, to a `json` file so that it can be imported into
other applications that understand the data. To export the data, run the <a href="#export-command">export command</a> 
when you are in the main level of the application. 

After running the command, the data will be exported to 
`export/data.json` under the same folder where **revisED** application resides. An example of the file content is shown 
below.

<sup>***Figure 3.4.5** Sample data.json content*</sup>

Note that the content of the file follows the same logical structure as that
in the `data/` folder.

> üìùÔ∏è Ô∏è **_NOTE:_** **Importing** of the exported file is **currently not supported** as it is meant to be read by other 
> applications. Nevertheless, the feature may be implemented in the future versions if it is highly requested.

#### 3.4.6 Sorting tasks  <a name= "sort"> </a>
The tasks in the application are sorted according to their deadlines. Tasks which are due soon are placed at the front
of the list, while tasks which are due later are placed at the rear. `Todo` tasks are placed at the end of the list since
they do not have any deadlines.

Suppose you use the `list` command and get this output:
<pre><code>
Here are the tasks(s) under maths: 
1. [D][‚úò] homework (by: 6:00 PM 6 Nov 2020)
2. [E][‚úò] marathon (at: 6:00 PM 9 Nov 2020)
</code></pre>

Adding the following deadline by `deadline project /by 18:00 07-11-2020` and using the `list` command would yield this output.
<pre><code>
Here are the tasks(s) under maths: 
1. [D][‚úò] homework (by: 6:00 PM 6 Nov 2020)
2. [D][‚úò] run again (by: 6:00 PM 7 Nov 2020)
3. [E][‚úò] marathon (at: 6:00 PM 9 Nov 2020)
</code></pre>


## 4. FAQ <a name = "faq"> </a>
This section answers some common questions that you may have about **revisED**.

**_Q:_ I moved the jar file to another location. Will my previous data be erased automatically?**<br>
**_A:_** Do not worry. You previous data will still be avaiable in the `data/` folder.

**_Q:_ I accidentally saved a task as an event, when it is a deadline. Is there any method to change the type of the task?**<br>
**_A:_** Unfortunately, no. You will have to delete the event using the `delete task [TASK_INDEX]`to delete the task, and then 
add the task back using the `deadline [DESCRIPTION] /by [TIME]` command.

**_Q:_ I stopped a quiz without completing it. Can I resume it?**<br>
**_A:_** No. You will have to start a new quiz.

**_Q:_ Is there any limit to the number of topics/subjects that I can store in my application?**<br>
**_A:_** No. You can store unlimited number of topics/subjects.   

**_Q:_ A file named `revisED0.log` appears in the folder after I run the application. What is it? Can I delete it?**<br>
**_A:_** This is the log file that logs down the activities of the application when you are running it. In the case where
you find any bugs or the application crashes, you can send us a bug report
[here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/issues) along with the log file to help us with solving the bugs. 
Nevertheless, you can delete it if you want to, and it does not affect the behavior of the application in any way.
