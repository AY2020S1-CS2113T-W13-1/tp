## 1. Introduction

revisED aims to help students to revise their subjects through the creation of flashcards or tasks that have
to be completed. The user can store the flashcards under different topics, which can be created under different
subjects. The tasks can be stored under subjects. This application ensures that students would be
able to revise, even if they are doing it at the last minute.

This user guide provides an in-depth documentation on the revisED installation process, the program features, and

### Storing of data 
The data added to the program is automatically saved to the disk when the application exits. Similarly, the application
loads the saved data from the disk automatically when it launches. The data is stored under the `data/` folder in the 
same folder where the application resides.

TODO: add hierarchy diagram

Instead of storing all data in one file, revisED creates a folder hierarchy following the logical structure of the
subjects and topics added. For example, if you add a `Maths` subject and a `Algebra` topic under it, a
`Maths/` folder will be created under the `data/` folder and an `Algebra` folder will be created under the `Maths/`
folder.

#### tasks.txt
There will be one `tasks.txt` file under each subject folder. This file contains the tasks (Todo, Event, Deadline) you
have added to the specific subject.

TODO: explain the format

#### results.json
This file can be found under each subject and topic folder. It stores the quiz results you have obtained from attempting
the quiz under a specific subject or topic.

TODO: explain the format

#### flashcards.json
This file stores all the flashcard data you have added under a specific subject and topic. It can be found under
each topic folder.

TODO: explain the format


### Exporting data
You can export all the data including the quiz results and tasks to a `json` file so that it can be imported into
other applications that understand the data.

Command: `export`

After running the command, the data will be exported to `export/data.json` under the same folder where the
application resides.
